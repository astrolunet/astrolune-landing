# Astrolune — technical documentation

A decentralised network on the **PoTB** (Proof of Trusted Behavior) consensus model, with its own virtual machine, a two-tier smart contract language system, and in time its own `.lune` DNS zone, storage and proxy services.

Directories are numbered in reading order: overview and consensus first, then architecture, VM, languages, services, roadmap, and finally what is actually built.

## Where to start

| If you want to… | Read |
|---|---|
| understand the project | [00-overview/vision.md](00-overview/vision.md) |
| understand the consensus model | [01-consensus/potb.md](01-consensus/potb.md) |
| **know what is actually implemented** | [08-implementation/implementation-status.md](08-implementation/implementation-status.md) |
| build and run it | [08-implementation/build-and-test.md](08-implementation/build-and-test.md) |
| write code against the core | [08-implementation/core-api.md](08-implementation/core-api.md) |
| run a local devnet | `scripts\smoke.ps1` and the `alnode run` command |
| know what to work on next | [07-roadmap/roadmap.md](07-roadmap/roadmap.md) |

**Before running anything:** the default signature backend and all current
VRF/VDF implementations are insecure development primitives. An optional
libsodium build provides real Ed25519 signatures, but the complete stack is not
yet production-safe. See [02-architecture/cryptography.md](02-architecture/cryptography.md).

## Status legend

- **stable** — designed and agreed; changes rarely.
- **draft** — working version; details still being settled.
- **skeleton** — a frame with the open questions fixed in writing; the substantive specification is deferred. A skeleton records what is *already constrained* by existing code and what is genuinely undecided. It does not invent a specification to look finished.
- **current** — describes the tree as it is now, and goes stale when the code changes.

## Two conventions worth knowing before reading anything else

**1. Where a header and a document disagree, the header is correct.** It is what nodes actually run, so the document is the bug. Every known case is listed in [08-implementation/implementation-status.md](08-implementation/implementation-status.md) §3. An empty §3 means the code and the specification agree, which is the goal.

**2. Open problems are recorded as open.** The ❌ markers in [01-consensus/potb.md](01-consensus/potb.md) §7 and the blunt assessments in the skeletons are deliberate. "Nobody dominates" is not mathematically proven and the documentation says so. Anything that reads as an admission of weakness is load-bearing information, not an unfinished draft.

## Priorities

1. **Production cryptography and storage maintenance** — replace development crypto, then add pruning and snapshot transfer before deployment.
2. **Contract languages** — compile Trocto/Regol into the fixed ALVM v1 container and host ABI.
3. **Storage, proxy, `.lune`** — deferred; skeletons only, by decision.

The public headers are compiled individually as C++23 and checked against the
221-symbol ABI manifest on every build. The remaining cryptographic prerequisite
for anything beyond simulation is production VRF/VDF resolution and pinned
packaging of the sodium signature backend.
